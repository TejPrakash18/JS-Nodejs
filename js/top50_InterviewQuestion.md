## JavaScript Questions and Answers (20)

1. **What is JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web content. It is primarily used for client-side scripting to enhance user interaction with web pages.
    
2. **What are variables in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    Variables are used to store data values in JavaScript. You can declare variables using var, let, and const.
    
    ```js
    let name = 'John';
    const age = 30;
    var city = 'New York';
    ```

3. **What is the difference between let, const, and var?**

    **Answer:**
    
    - `var`: Declares variables with function scope.
    - `let`: Declares block-scoped variables, can be reassigned.
    - `const`: Declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned.

4. **What are data types in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    JavaScript has primitive types and reference types:
    
    - Primitive: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
    - Reference: object, array, function

5. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed.

    ```js
    function outer() {
      let count = 0;
      return function inner() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
      };
    }
    const counter = outer();
    counter(); // 1
    counter(); // 2
    ```

6. **What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    
    - `==`: Compares values, performing type coercion.
    - `===`: Compares both value and type, no type coercion.

7. **What is a callback function in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument and executed later.

    ```js
    function greet(name, callback) {
      console.log('Hello, ' + name);
      callback();
    }
    
    greet('John', function() {
      console.log('Callback function executed!');
    });
    ```

8. **What are promises in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    A Promise represents the completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

    ```js
    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let success = true;
      if(success) {
        resolve("Task Completed!");
      } else {
        reject("Task Failed!");
      }
    });
    
    promise.then((message) => console.log(message)).catch((error) => console.log(error));
    ```

9. **What is async/await in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    async/await is syntactic sugar for working with promises. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous manner.

    ```js
    async function fetchData() {
      let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
      let data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
    }
    fetchData();
    ```

10. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    The event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, by executing code, collecting and processing events, and executing sub-tasks.

11. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of their containing scope during compile time.

    ```js
    console.log(a); // undefined
    var a = 10;
    ```

12. **What are arrow functions in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and do not have their own `this` context.

    ```js
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
    ```

13. **What is `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    `this` refers to the current context of the function it is used in. Its value depends on how the function is called.

14. **What are JavaScript arrays?**

    **Answer:**
    An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values of any type.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    console.log(arr[0]); // 1
    ```

15. **What is the difference between null and undefined?**

    **Answer:**
    
    - `null`: A value representing the intentional absence of any object value.
    - `undefined`: A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

16. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

    ```js
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    const { name, age } = person;
    console.log(name, age); // John 30
    ```

17. **What is the spread operator in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    The spread operator `...` is used to unpack elements of an array or object.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
    console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

18. **What is the map() function in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let newArr = arr.map(x => x * 2);
    console.log(newArr); // [2, 4, 6]
    ```

19. **What is the filter() function in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    `filter()` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let newArr = arr.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
    console.log(newArr); // [2, 4]
    ```

20. **What is the reduce() function in JavaScript?**

    **Answer:**
    `reduce()` executes a reducer function (callback) on each element in the array, resulting in a single output value.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let sum = arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
    console.log(sum); // 10
    ```
